Site Demo: https://netflix-react-bcf45.web.app

A Netflix clone made using React is a web application that imitates the design and functionality of the popular streaming platform, Netflix. The main goal of this project is for me to understand React fundamentals by building a project that mimics a real-world application.

The clone typically has features such as a landing page that displays a list of movies or TV shows, user login and authentication using Firebase, environment variables to hide API keys.

The application is built using React components, which allow for modular and reusable code. These components are responsible for displaying specific parts of the application, such as the header, footer, and individual movie or TV show cards. The use of state and props in React allows for dynamic rendering of content, such as updating the list of titles when a movie is saved.

To fetch data from an external API, such as the TMDB (The Movie Database) API, the application uses Axios . This allows the clone to retrieve information about movies and TV shows, including their titles, descriptions, and movie poster.

Overall, building a Netflix clone with React is a great way to learn the basics of React, as well as other web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
